# GDPR

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) takes effect **May 25, 2018**.

This repository is a high level collection of information regarding the GDPR and what information developers need to know.

## Personal Data

Personal data defined as "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person". This can be a single piece of information or a collection combined to create a record. Examples of personal data are as follows:

* Name
* Home address
* Photo
* Email address
* Bank details
* Posts on social networking websites
* IP Addresses

## Sensitive Personal Data

Sensitive personal data is expanded on a person's personal data and requires stricter protections than regular personal data. The information regarded as sensitive personal data are as follows:

* Racial or ethnic origin
* Political opinions
* Religious or philisophical beliefs
* Trade union membership
* Health data
* Sex life or sexual orientation
* Past or spent criminal convictions
* Genetic data
* Biometric data (facial recognition or fingerprint logins)
* Location data
* Pseudonymised data
* Online identifiers

## Data Breaches

Companies and organizations must notify the national supervisory authority of serious data breaches as soon as possible (if feasible within 24 hours).

## Data Portability

People must have access to their own data and be able to transfer personal data from one service provider to another. The data must be provided in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.

## Right to be Forgotten

A right to be forgotten will help people better manage data protection risks online: people will be able to delete their data if there are no legitimate grounds for retaining it.

## Data Protection Impact Assessments

Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA), is a required document pertaining to data-intensive projects. This document will outline questions which will need to be readily available to all individuals involved with the project. Data protection regulators may request the DPIA documents in the event of a data breach.
